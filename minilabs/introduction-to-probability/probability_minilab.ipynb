Before you answer that question, know thatno test is 100% perfect or reliable. Every test has a *false positive* and *false negative* rate. A false positive means that the test says that a person has a disease when in reality they don't. Similarly, a false negative means that the test says that a person does not have a disease when in reality they do. COVID-19 false negative and false positve rates fluctuate between the test and news source, therefore, _we will not be using actual data for these values._ We'll instead be using fictitious data from a far off university called the University of Cubeifornia, Blockeley. Blockeley Univeristy (as the students call it) is located in Blockeley, Cubeifornia. \n",
